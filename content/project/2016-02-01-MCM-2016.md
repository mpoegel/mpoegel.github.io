A three-person team thrown together at the last minute somehow managed to put this together in a weekend for the Mathematical Contest in Modeling 2016. The [challenge](http://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/contests/2016/problems/2016_MCM_Problem_C.pdf) was to create a proposal for a charity the outlined the optimal strategy for donations to universities in the United States. Our [write-up](/assets/mcm_2016.pdf) earned an honorable mention.
