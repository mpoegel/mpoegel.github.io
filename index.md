## Hello, World!

This is my in progress hackathon blog and project portfolio. I record my experiences at [hackathons](/hackathons) I've attended (save Freshmen year). Why? I don't know, why not?

Probably of more interest, I post about my favorite [side projects](/projects) that I have worked on over the years, mostly those that have started at hackathons. My goal is to keep the pages updated as progress is made on the projects. We'll see how it goes!

Like what you see? I am always looking for more opportunities to increase my skills base. [Hire me!](/bio)
