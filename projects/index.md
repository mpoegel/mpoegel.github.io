This is my projects page.

This is a more detailed description of my projects than what can be found on my [github](http://github.com/mpoegel). I've highlighted my favorite projects, most of which have started at hackathons, and described the process, how they work, and what I learned. My goal is to keep the pages updated as I work on each project.
