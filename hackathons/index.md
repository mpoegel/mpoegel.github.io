## Hello, World!

This is my hackathon blog.

Hackathons are awesome! Hackathons are 24-48 hour coding marathons where students get together, usually at another school, to create a project completed from start to finish within the allotted time period and compete for prizes. It's a great way to learn something, gain experience, have fun, and make connections. For more information, check out [Major League Hacking](http://mlh.io).

The best hackathon, of course, is HackRPI. The first HackRPI was November 15-16, 2014 and is completely student organized. Support/sponsor [HackRPI](http://hackrpi.com) or the [Rensselaer Hackathon Organization](/). You can also [contact me](/assets/resume.pdf) directly to get involved.
