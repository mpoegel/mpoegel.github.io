## Hello, World!

My name is Matt Poegel. I am a sophomore at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY as a dual Mathematics and Computer Science major. My current interests are focused on data analysis. I enjoy the cross between the mathematics, computer algorithms, and problem solving. Having some experience in this area has peaked my interest and driven me to explore as much as I can in my own time, outside of classes.

My contact information can be found on my [resume](/assets/resume.pdf).

I was one of the main organizers of [HackRPI 2014](/hack/HackRPI_2014.html). This was RPI's very first hackathon and it was completely student organized.

My biggest contribution was (and continues to be), [Status Board](https://github.com/mpoegel/HackRPI-Status-Board).
