## Hello, World!

My name is Matt Poegel. I am a sophomore at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY as a dual Mathematics and Computer Science major. My current interests are focused on data analysis. I enjoy the cross between the mathematics, computer algorithms, and problem solving. Having some experience in this area has peaked my interest and driven me to explore as much as I can in my own time, outside of classes.

My contact information can be found on my [resume](/assets/resume.pdf).

I was one of the main organizers of [HackRPI 2014](/hack/HackRPI_2014.html)! This was RPI's very first hackathon and it was completely student organized. I look forward to helping again with HackRPI 2015.

**Hacks out of Hat Chair**.
I am the lead organizer for a smaller hackathon at RPI, Hacks out of Hat. At Hacks out of a Hat, hackers receive a random app idea from the [hat](/projects/hackathon_sorting_hat.html), which I built at [HackRU](/hack/HackRU_Fall2014.html). We aim to hold Hacks out of a Hat this spring in 2015 and host 100-200 local hackers.

#### Computer Science Club
**Member**. The CS club is a general computer science club that links together all of the computer science related clubs on campus. It also organizes outreach to the local community.

#### Web Technologies Group
**Member**. The division of RPI's student government that develops applications to improve student life. Projects can be found [here](http://github.com/wtg).
